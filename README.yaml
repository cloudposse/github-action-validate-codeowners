# Short description of this project

  Github Action Validate CODEOWNERS runs a series of checks on the CODEOWNERS file to ensure that it's valid and well-linted.

  Ensuring your repository's CODEOWNERS file is valid can be critical to the development process if, for instance, your project uses [branch protection](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches) conditions that rely on definitions in CODEOWNERS.
# Introduction to the project
#introduction: |-
#  This is an introduction.

# How to use this project
usage: |-
  Copy the `sample_workflow_file.yml` file from this repository into the `.github/workflows` folder of the repository to which you'd like to add Validate CODEOWNERS functionality.
  This will cause the validation functionality to execute whenever any event occurs on any pull request, or whenever an owner of the repository requests it, via the `workflow_dispatch` trigger.

# Example usage
#examples: |-
#  Here are some real world examples:
#  - [`github-authorized-keys`](https://github.com/cloudposse/github-authorized-keys/) - A Golang project that leverages `docker/%`, `go/%`, `travis/%` targets
#  - [`charts`](https://github.com/cloudposse/charts/) - A collection of Helm Charts that leverages `docker/%` and `helm/%` targets
#  - [`bastion`](https://github.com/cloudposse/bastion/) - A docker image that leverages `docker/%` and `bash/lint` targets
#  - [`terraform-null-label`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label/) - A terraform module that leverages `terraform/%` targets

# How to get started quickly
#quickstart: |-
#  Here's how to get started...
#  1. `git clone https://github.com/cloudposse/build-harness.git` to pull down the repository
#  2. `make init` to initialize the [`build-harness`](https://github.com/cloudposse/build-harness/)
